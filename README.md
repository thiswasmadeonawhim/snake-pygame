# Snake Eater CUSTOM
A snake game written in Python using the Pygame library.

Specifically, I'm editing snake to be Touken Ranbu Mochi-Mochis! This is gonna be a long wip but I hope to get it running online so you don't need to DL anything to play. I plan on also fixing up things like font and display to make it more Sword. Update logs will be added below.


## Installing
Download the Python 3 installer package from the official website and install it, if not installed previously.

Run the following in the terminal to install the Pygame library
```
pip3 install pygame
```


## Running the application
Download the source code from the repository and run the file just as any other Python script (.py) file.
```
python3 Snake\ Game.py
```

The `difficulty` variable can be changed with the values provided in the comment to set the difficulty level.

The rest of the code is properly commented and self explanatory. Tweaks can be made to change the play style or visuals of the game.
